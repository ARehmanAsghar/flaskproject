# [Star Wars 3D Models & Blueprints: Front End Web App using Flask](https://star-wars-3d-models-blueprints.herokuapp.com/)
### Homework from [Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science CS50 hosted on eDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)
### ðŸŽ“ [Web Track](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/)
- [Homepage](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/homepage/): Tasked to build a simple homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I took this as an opportunity to go beyond this by practicing design.
- I wrote all of the code in this repository, except index.js

## ðŸ’¡Lessons Learned
- Wireframing and Prototyping in AdobeXD
- Mobile-first design
- SVG code in-line within HTML
- Advanced CSS animations
- Deploying a Flask application on Heroku

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run this project locally:
- In your terminal, navigate to the root project directory and run the following commands
- Activate the virtual environment
```
$ pipenv shell
```
- To install the dependencies
```
$ pip install Flask
$ pipenv install Flask
```
- To start the web server, execute (without debugging):
```
$ python application.py 
```
- Alternatively, execute (without debugging):
```

```
- Note to self that there is a seperate branch `herokudeploy` for deploying files that are ignored when pushing to github.
